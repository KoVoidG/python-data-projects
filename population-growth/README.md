# Logistic Population Growth Model â€“ Green Sea Turtles

This Python script models the estimated population growth of green sea turtles in Thailand, Australia, and Costa Rica using a logistic growth function. The model visualizes the long-term population trajectory under resource limitations and carrying capacity.

##  Features

- Simulates turtle population growth across three regions
- Uses a logistic growth function to model realistic environmental limits
- Clearly labeled multi-line graph for comparison
- Adjustable parameters for growth rate, initial population, and carrying capacity

## Visualization

The output consists of a single line graph showing:

- Population estimates over 100 years
- Comparison across **Thailand**, **Australia**, and **Costa Rica**
- Smooth population curves that approach each regionâ€™s carrying capacity

##  Calculation Logic

The model uses the **logistic growth function**:

```bash
P(t) = K / (1 + A Â· e^(â€“rÂ·t))
where A = (K â€“ Pâ‚€) / Pâ‚€
```

Where:  
- **Pâ‚€** = initial population  
- **K** = carrying capacity  
- **r** = growth rate  
- **t** = time in years  

Each country has its own set of parameters:
- Thailand: Pâ‚€ = 1000, K = 2000, r = 0.005  
- Australia: Pâ‚€ = 35,000, K = 60,000, r = 0.005  
- Costa Rica: Pâ‚€ = 18,000, K = 100,000, r = 0.04
